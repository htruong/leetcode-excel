Solutions to leetcode problems, written in the Microsoft Excel programming language (TM).

If you get asked by the interviewer to program in any language you like, please strongly consider Microsoft Excel as your language of choice. You are free to copy my Excel """code""". I claim no copyright on them and will never rat you out.
