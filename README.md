# leetcode-excel

Solutions to leetcode problems, written in the Microsoft Excel programming language (TM).

You are free to copy my Excel """code""". I claim no copyright on them and will never rat you out.

So next time, if you get asked by the interviewer to program in any popular programming language you like, please just insist Microsoft Excel being your language of choice. 

If you get hired by providing my answers, please I suggest you to buy me a beer to me by sending a Paypal donation to `htruong@tnhh.net`.
